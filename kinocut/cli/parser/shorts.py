"""CLI parser for the `kino shorts` long-form-to-verticals orchestrator.

The orchestrator business logic lives in :mod:`kinocut.product.shorts`; this
module is a thin argparse adapter that registers the canonical command and
documents every flag with plain-language help (no engine / model jargon). The
default mode stops after proposals: nothing is rendered until the operator
explicitly approves a rendered run through the orchestrator.
