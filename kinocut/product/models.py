"""Strict product-domain models for the long-form stream-to-shorts workflow.

The models in this module are the *public contract* for moment discovery and
downstream ShortsPlan composition. Every model is:

* **Strict** — ``extra="forbid"``, ``frozen=True``, ``allow_inf_nan=False`` so a
  caller cannot smuggle unknown fields, mutate state, or sneak a NaN into a
  canonical JSON payload.
* **JSON-stable** — every field round-trips through ``model_dump(mode="json")``
  with sorted keys + compact separators; ``dedup_key`` is a stable sha256 hex
  digest that other slices can reproduce byte-for-byte.
* **Decoupled from engines** — these are VALUE OBJECTS, not records. The
  downstream render-op emission (which lives in
  ``kinocut.product.shorts``/``kinocut.workflow.executor``) consumes these
  models but never the other way around. No engine import is performed here.

Human review remains mandatory before any render: every :class:`CandidateMoment`
carries a ``review_warning`` (or ``None`` when none applies) and an
``unsuitable`` flag so reviewers can act on the proposal rather than accept it
blind.
