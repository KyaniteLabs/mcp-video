"""Deterministic multi-moment discovery from transcript segments.

The discovery layer is pure: given a transcript (an ordered sequence of
:class:`TranscriptSegment`) plus optional :class:`SourceSignal` evidence, it
returns a strict :class:`HighlightDiscoveryResult`. It performs no I/O and
imports no engine — analysis (transcription, scene detection, audio probing)
lives outside this slice per the workflow contract.

Selection rules (enforced pragmatically from observed transcript boundaries):

* **No leading silence** — the start of every candidate is the start of the
  first non-silent, word-bearing segment in the window. A window that begins
  with silence is shifted forward to the next speech segment; if no such
  segment exists, the window is dropped.
* **Complete-thought boundary** — the end of every candidate prefers the
  next sentence-terminal punctuation mark (``.``, ``!``, ``?``) within
  ``max_duration``; falling back to the natural segment end when none exists.
* **Payoff** — the window must contain at least one clause-terminal marker so
  a rendered clip resolves rather than trailing off mid-thought.
* **Bounds** — every candidate satisfies ``0 <= start < end``; ``start`` and
  ``end`` are both monotonic across the candidate list.
* **Duration** — every candidate is clamped to ``[min_duration, max_duration]``
  from :class:`HighlightDiscoveryConfig`.
* **Duplicate suppression** — candidates that collide on the same
  ``dedup_key`` (canonical content + start/end + sensitivity) are collapsed,
  keeping the highest-confidence variant.
* **Honest fewer** — degenerate input (empty transcript, all-silence, no
  payoff) returns the candidates it can justify, never padded weak output.

The function is pure and deterministic: two calls with the same inputs in the
same Python version produce byte-identical :class:`HighlightDiscoveryResult`
instances (the only source of nondeterminism is ``id()`` of empty tuples, which
the orchestrator never inspects).
