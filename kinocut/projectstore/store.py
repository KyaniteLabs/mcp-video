"""Append-only, lock-guarded record store (Plan 00 Task 3).

Records are appended to ``.kinocut/records/<kind>.jsonl`` one canonical JSON
line at a time, under an exclusive project lock, via a securely-created
same-directory temp file (``mkstemp`` → ``fsync`` → :func:`os.replace`). Because
the temp name is unpredictable and the swap is atomic on a POSIX filesystem, a
failed write can never truncate the prior file, and a pre-planted symlink can
never redirect the write outside the store.

History is **append-only**: a correction is a new record that *supersedes* an
earlier one by ``record_id``; the earlier record is never edited or removed.
Supersession is validated (exactly one existing, same-project, not-yet-superseded
target) and must not form a cycle. Every record is re-validated through its
``record_kind``-bound concrete model at the write boundary, so a tampered or
wrong-subclass record cannot be persisted. Every public boundary maps raw
filesystem/JSON errors to a stable, privacy-safe :class:`MCPVideoError`.
