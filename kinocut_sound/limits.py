"""Resource ceilings and hard bounds for ``kinocut_sound``.

Maximum/minimum bounds that protect against resource exhaustion and enforce
design ceilings. Centralising them here keeps magic numbers out of contract
modules and makes the ceiling surface auditable in one place.

Nothing in this module imports from ``kinocut`` runtime or from other
``kinocut_sound`` contract modules, so it is safe to import from any layer.
