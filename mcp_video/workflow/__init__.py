"""Agent-native workflow engine (validate / plan / render / inspect).

Story 1 ships the ordered-list job-spec model and the fail-closed structural
validator (op allowlist, @ref resolution, backward-reference-only ordering,
per-op param introspection, workspace-confined path safety). Planner, render,
resume, and inspect land in later stories on top of this spine.
