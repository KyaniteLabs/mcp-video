Here is a strategic synthesis for positioning `mcp-video` as the default media layer for AI agents, structured as requested.

## 1. Wedge Features: The "You Have to Try This" Moments

These features are designed to create viral "aha!" moments when an agent user (e.g., in Claude Code or Cursor) realizes they can manipulate video programmatically with natural language, without leaving their editor.

1.  **"Magic B-Roll" (Auto-B-Roll Ingestion)**
    *   **Pitch:** "Hey Claude, find the moments where I say 'AI agents' in this talking-head video and overlay these 3 stock clips from Pexels."
    *   **Why it demos well:** Shows a complex editing task (audio transcription -> timestamp mapping -> video overlay) happening in one prompt. Visually satisfying instant result.
    *   **Difficulty:** Medium (Combines Whisper, scene detection, and basic FFmpeg overlay).
2.  **"Censorship Sniper" (Auto-Bleep & Blur)**
    *   **Pitch:** "Review this 5-minute clip, bleep out any profanity, and blur the license plates."
    *   **Why it demos well:** Demonstrates the safety/guardrail aspect. You see a raw clip go in and a compliant clip come out with zero manual scrubbing.
    *   **Difficulty:** High (Requires Whisper for audio + VLM/object detection for visual blurring + precise timestamp alignment).
3.  **"The TikTokifier" (Vertical Repurposing Pipeline)**
    *   **Pitch:** "Take this 16:9 webinar, track the speaker's face to keep them centered, and crop it to 9:16 for Shorts."
    *   **Why it demos well:** Solves a massive, tedious pain point for creators instantly. The visual transition from wide to vertical with face-tracking is a classic "wow" moment.
    *   **Difficulty:** Medium-High (Requires face-tracking heuristics or OpenCV integration alongside FFmpeg cropping).
4.  **"Data-Driven Highlight Reel" (VMAF-Optimized Cuts)**
    *   **Pitch:** "Extract the 3 most visually dynamic 10-second segments from this drone footage."
    *   **Why it demos well:** Proves it's not just blind cutting. It shows the agent using VMAF/quality metrics as a decision engine, making "smart" creative choices.
    *   **Difficulty:** Medium (Relies heavily on existing VMAF tooling and scene detection).
5.  **"Kinetic Typography Engine" (Hyperframes HTML-to-Video)**
    *   **Pitch:** "Generate a neon-punk animated title card using this HTML/CSS and composite it over the intro."
    *   **Why it demos well:** Bridges web dev skills with video editing. Devs love seeing their CSS animations turn into burned-in video graphics.
    *   **Difficulty:** Medium (Leverages the existing Hyperframes feature, just needs a slick API wrapper).
6.  **"Silence Assassin" (Smart Jump Cuts)**
    *   **Pitch:** "Remove all silences longer than 0.5 seconds and add a subtle 1.1x zoom punch-in on every cut."
    *   **Why it demos well:** A standard YouTube editing technique automated in seconds. The punch-ins make the automation look intentional and human-edited.
    *   **Difficulty:** Medium (Audio waveform analysis + basic scale manipulation).
7.  **"The 'Fix It In Post' Command" (Automated Audio/Color Rescue)**
    *   **Pitch:** "Normalize the audio to -14 LUFS, remove the background hum, and apply a standard Rec.709 color correction."
    *   **Why it demos well:** Shows technical competence. The before/after audio comparison is always a strong demo.
    *   **Difficulty:** Low (Straightforward FFmpeg audio/video filters).
8.  **"Agentic Storyboarding" (Prompt-to-Timeline)**
    *   **Pitch:** "Draft a 30-second timeline JSON combining these 5 clips based on a 'hero's journey' arc."
    *   **Why it demos well:** Shows the *planning* phase before the render. Developers like seeing the structured JSON timeline the agent generates before executing the heavy FFmpeg command.
    *   **Difficulty:** Low (Mostly prompt engineering and JSON validation).
9.  **"The Generative Handoff" (Sora/Kling Post-Processor)**
    *   **Pitch:** "Take this raw API output from Sora, upscale it, interpolate to 60fps, and add cinematic letterboxing."
    *   **Why it demos well:** Positions `mcp-video` as the essential "last mile" for the new wave of generative video models, which often output raw, unpolished files.
    *   **Difficulty:** Low (Standard FFmpeg wrappers, but high perceived value).
10. **"The Anti-Slop Guardrail" (Preflight Quality Check)**
    *   **Pitch:** "Before rendering, check if this FFmpeg command will result in a file over 500MB or cause audio desync, and suggest a fix."
    *   **Why it demos well:** The core differentiator. Shows the agent *preventing* a mistake and correcting its own code before wasting compute time.
    *   **Difficulty:** High (Requires complex parsing of FFmpeg command intent and dry-run heuristics).

## 2. Integration Surface: Becoming the Default Media Layer

To become the default, `mcp-video` needs to exist wherever agents (and the developers building them) live.

*   **Primary: The One-Line Agent Install:**
    *   **Claude Desktop / Cursor:** Needs to be as simple as `npx @kyanitelabs/mcp-video install` or a one-click addition in the Claude Desktop config. If it takes more than 2 minutes to get the server running, you lose the audience.
*   **Secondary: Framework Bridges (LangChain / LlamaIndex / CrewAI):**
    *   Provide pre-built toolkits (`from langchain_mcp_video import VideoToolkit`). Agents built in these frameworks should just import the toolkit to suddenly gain 119 video capabilities.
*   **Tertiary: The CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions):**
    *   `mcp-video-action`: A GitHub action that uses the VMAF/quality metrics to do visual regression testing on video outputs. "Did this PR break the automated rendering pipeline? Fail the build if VMAF drops below 90."
*   **Quaternary: Generative API Glue:**
    *   Tools specifically designed to wrap the outputs of Runway, Luma, Veo, and Sora. When an agent calls a generative API, the natural next step should be passing that blob to `mcp-video` for upscaling, watermark removal (if legal), and audio stitching.
*   **Quinary: No-Code Nodes (n8n):**
    *   While agents are the focus, providing an n8n node exposes the underlying tools to a massive audience of workflow automators who are currently struggling with raw FFmpeg commands in bash nodes.

## 3. Sketch: Self-Reviewing Video (The "Director" Loop)

The most powerful agentic workflow is self-correction. If an agent can watch its own output, it doesn't need human supervision.

**The Loop:**
1.  **Generate:** Agent executes an edit (e.g., overlaying a title).
2.  **Sample:** `mcp-video` extracts keyframes around the edit points (e.g., at t=5s, t=6s, t=7s).
3.  **Grade (VLM):** The agent passes the frames to a Vision-Language Model (like Claude 3.5 Sonnet) with a rubric: *"Is the title text legible? Is it overlapping the subject's face? Is the contrast sufficient?"*
4.  **Analyze (Heuristics):** `mcp-video` runs objective checks (VMAF for pixelation, EBU R128 for audio clipping).
5.  **Iterate:** If the VLM says "text is unreadable" or the audio check fails, the agent rewrites the FFmpeg command (e.g., adding a drop shadow to the text, lowering audio gain) and re-renders.

**Required Tools API Sketch:**

```python
# 1. The Sampler
def extract_keyframes(video_path: str, timestamps: list[float]) -> list[str]:
    """Extracts frames at specific timestamps as base64 JPEGs for VLM review."""
    pass

# 2. The Objective Grader
def run_quality_diagnostics(video_path: str) -> dict:
    """Returns objective metrics: VMAF score, audio LUFS, black frame detection."""
    pass

# 3. The Guardrail (Pre-flight)
def validate_edit_intent(timeline_json: dict) -> list[str]:
    """Checks for overlapping audio tracks, out-of-bounds crops, or impossible frame rates before rendering."""
    pass
```

## 4. The Obsession: Which Audience First?

**Recommendation:** Obsess over **AI-App Builders needing programmatic video (The Devs).**

**Why not the others?**
*   *Faceless-channel operators:* They want polished UIs (like Opus Clip or CapCut), not an MCP server. They don't write code.
*   *Dev-tool marketers:* Too niche, and they usually hire human editors for high-quality product videos.
*   *Podcast repurposers:* A crowded market with heavily funded incumbents (Riverside, Descript) who already have vertically integrated solutions.

**Why AI-App Builders?**
This is the only audience that directly benefits from an **API/MCP-first approach**. There is a massive wave of developers trying to build "AI video generators" or "automated marketing engines."
Right now, their biggest bottleneck is fighting with FFmpeg wrappers in Python or Node.js, trying to stitch together TTS audio, generated images, and video clips without the file corrupting.

If `mcp-video` solves the *infrastructure* problem of programmatic video manipulation with built-in guardrails, it becomes the underlying engine for hundreds of downstream SaaS apps. You win by being the shovel provider in the AI video gold rush. Your messaging should be: *"Stop fighting FFmpeg. Let your agents handle the video pipeline safely."*
