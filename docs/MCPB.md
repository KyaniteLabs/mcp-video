# Kinocut MCPB

Kinocut's MCPB package is a local stdio launcher for Claude Desktop-style hosts that install `.mcpb` files.

MCPB does not bundle Python, Kinocut, FFmpeg, Node, Hyperframes, or AI model weights in this staged package. It launches an existing Python environment with `python -m kinocut --mcp`, so the current CLI, MCP tool names, Python package, `mcp-video` compatibility shim, and FFmpeg behavior stay unchanged.

## Runtime Requirements

- Node.js 18 or newer, used only by the MCPB launcher.
- Python 3.11 or newer with `kinocut==1.7.0` installed.
- FFmpeg and ffprobe available on `PATH`, or FFmpeg configured through the installer field.
- Optional AI features require the matching Kinocut extras and local model dependencies.
- Hyperframes tools require a resolvable Hyperframes command; leave the field blank if you do not use those tools.

## Directory Configuration

The manifest asks for two directories:

- `workspaceRoot`: the source-media folder you intend to expose.
- `outputRoot`: the folder for generated media.

Choose the narrowest folders that fit the workflow. MCPB has no platform sandbox, so this configuration is an install-time safety prompt and documentation contract rather than an OS-enforced permission boundary. Kinocut's existing tool and workflow guardrails still validate their own paths, and workflow specs remain workspace-confined, but legacy direct tools can still receive absolute paths from the client.

## Build And Validate

Build the local artifact without publishing:

```bash
python3 scripts/build-mcpb.py
```

The script validates the v0.4 manifest fields used by this package and writes:

```text
dist/kinocut-1.7.0.mcpb
```

Focused validation:

```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/test_kinocut_distribution.py::test_mcpb_distribution_is_truthful_and_buildable -q
node mcpb/server/launcher.js
```

The launcher command should be tested through an MCP client or inspector because it starts a long-running stdio server.

## Release Gate Before External Publication

Do not publish this MCPB package externally until these gates are closed:

- Validate with the official `@anthropic-ai/mcpb` validator when it is available in CI.
- Test install on clean macOS, Linux, and Windows machines without repository-local imports.
- Decide whether to keep this staged launcher or produce per-platform bundles that include Python, Kinocut, and FFmpeg.
- Add enforced MCPB runtime confinement for direct-tool absolute paths, or keep the package clearly labeled as user-configured local access.
- Verify optional AI and Hyperframes behavior with dependencies absent and present.
